			<h3>Part 2</h3>
			<p>For the rest of the day, Maddie was in the back of Nick’s mind. Just when he was deep into something, the thought of her comes back for a split moment. He goes to sleep expecting to forget the encounter as if it was a dream, but alas it was not.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Nick wakes from his sleep as usual and gets set for the day. He heads off to school, though his mind still focused on what happened the day before. “Come on Nick. Get it together,” he says to himself as he slaps his head trying to forget, “It’s a new semester, you can’t let the past get to you.” </p>
			<br>
			<p>Walking through the front doors of school, he is once again presented with the hustle and bustle of school life. Kids going to lockers and trying to traverse the manic intersections, pushing past one another. All the while Nick immediately sees the one thing he didn’t want to. Right in the middle of the crowd, there she was. In her big group of friends, Nick keeps his head low as he passes Maddie, trying not to draw attention.</p>
			<br>
			<p>These encounters would happen more often than not. He would see her walking the halls, at her locker, and even out on the field for gym. Each time it doesn’t look like she notices him, but Nick has a slight suspicion that she does anyway.</p>
			<br>
			<p>On his way to fourth period, Nick see Maddie talking on the side of the hall to another girl. He keeps his head low once more, passing the two. Completely focused on Maddie, Nick doesn't notice about student coming and is pushed aside. When pushed, he could feel someone behind him. Turning around, he notices Maddie on the floor. Her friend surprised of the sudden event. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Nick reaches down, “Are you okay, Ma-,” he gets cut off before he could get her name out.</p>
			<br>
			<p>“Hey! Watch where you're going, punk! Maddie is fuming. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Scaring Nick, he retracts his hand as if she was a cat who was close to biting him. “I-I'm sorry,” he apologizes, “Somebody bumped into me and-.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>“I don’t wanna hear it,” Maddie cuts him off again. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Nick scurries off to his class, sweating from the accidental encounter. Maddie picks herself up off the floor and brushes herself off. </p>
			<br>
			<p>“Hey Maddie?” her friend speaks up, “are you okay, you seem a bit on edge.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>“Huh? Oh, yeah I’m feeling fine. Why do you ask?” Maddie reverts back to normal self.</p>
			<br>
			<p>“Well it seems like you’re acting different since yesterday when you went off with that guy. By the way, wasn’t that the same guy?” the girl curious to ask. </p>
			<br>
			<p>“Nah that was some other guy,” Maddie defends herself, “Haven’t seen him in my life.” She smiles in the direction of her friend, trying to play it off as nothing.</p>
			<br>
			<p>“Uh huh,” the other girl takes her answer, “Well I gotta go, class is starting soon.” They both wave goodbye and head their separate ways. As soon as she turns around, Maddie pulls out her phone and starts typing.</p>
			<br>
			<p id="divider">---</p>
			<br>
			<p>Buzz buzz. Getting ready for class, Nick’s phone starts vibrating on the table. He picks up the phone to see a message from the girl he had just bumped into.</p>
			<br>
			<p>“WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT,” the text read.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Nick could practically hear the text screaming at him and quickly goes on the defensive, “It was an accident. Someone bumped into me I swear.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>“Well it better not happen again you got that? I don’t want to see you around me ever again.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>The bell rings and Nick puts down the phone with a sigh. At this point he just wants to get today done and over with. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Ms. Blake walks to the front of the room. “Okay class, today is the start of the new semester and we will be learning more about everyone’s favorite trigonometry.” She begins to write on the board when the door opens up. “Oh, that’s right. I completely forgot,” a girl steps through the door and Ms. Blake holds out her arm for her introduction. Turning to face the class, Nick goes wide eyed. Their eyes meeting one another and his day went from bad to worse. “Class please welcome the newest member of our class, Madeline O’Dwyer.” </p>
