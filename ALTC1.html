			<h3>Part 1</h3>
			<p>After being finished with his last final of fall semester, Nick is anxious to get back home. Not doing great, but also not doing terrible, his mind is fixated on what he can do in the extra free time he has at home. That is, until he bumped into the unexpected.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Nick is that you?” A very perky voice pops out of nowhere. Nick is grabbed by the arm and turned around. “Oh my God it is you,” he is now faced with a girl he hasn't ever seen in his life. Standing there with a bit of a puzzled look on his face, she continues on, “I'm sorry guys I'll catch up with you later.” She waves to the group she's with and pulls Nick into the cafe next door.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The girl sits him down at a table and just smiles and faked a laugh. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ummmm…” Nick is still confused at what is going on.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Just smile and laugh,” The girl says from out of her grin, her voice very tense.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick does what she says and notices her periodically looking out of the window. It wasn't until her group left the window that she let her facade down. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ugh. I thought they'd never leave,” the distain in her voice matching her new disgusted face.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“I'm sorry,” Nick pipes up, “have we met before? You know my name, but I've never seen you in my life.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You really don't remember?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick focuses and his mind begins to churn like a machine. He analyzes her face and starts to recognize the voice and then it comes to him. “Maddie?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>She waves a tiny bit with a small grin on her face, “It's been a long time hasn't it.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick is in disbelief. Is that actually the same girl from 8th grade? “No it couldn't be,” he thought to himself.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You can't be Maddie. Maddie was a brunette, not blonde and didn't have any friends.” He says exasperatedly.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Wow, thanks, Nick,” there was a familiar coldness to those words as they left Maddie's mouth.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>It takes some time, but Nick finally accepts that she is that girl from his past. They spend the next few minutes catching up. Due to her drastic lifestyle changes, Nick comes to understand why he hasn't seen her at school.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“And to think I thought you just moved away.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Nope, I'm still around. Not taking much special at school, just normal classes,” Maddie checks her phone, “Oh shoot, I'm sorry. I gotta go.” She gets up out of her chair with her bag in hand. “It's been really nice talking to you again, Nick,” a smile forms on her face.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It's been nice seeing you too…” Nick says a little bit disappointed that she couldn't stay longer. However, as she turns to leave he speaks up. “Hey, Maddie?” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Hm?” she turns back around, “What's up?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Do you still like anime?” his question comes from nowhere, “I remember you being really into it when we were in middle school.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Pfffft. No,” Maddie plays it off as nothing, albeit with a bit of nervousness to get voice. “Why would I have any interest in that weeaboo trash?” clearly offended, Nick reels back from her response, “I've long out grown that stuff.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Just as she was about to leave the table, she is bumped into, dropping her bag and spilling its contents. “Oh I'm sorry Miss,” the passerby apologizes continuing on.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh shoot,” on the floor, Maddie hastily picks up get belongings into her bag.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>As she scrambles, a book slides over to Nick's foot. He picks it up for a closer look. “<i>My Little Sister is a Magical Girl?!?</i>, what the heck is this?” he starts to read the back, “One day, High School student Mitsuharu learns that his little sister, Hanako, is a magical girl. Unknown to everyone, he has to keep it a secret from everyone, including their parents, so Hanako’s identity isn’t revealed. Knowing the dangers that come from being a magical girl, how will Mitsuharu protect both his little sister and her identity from the world?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>All the while Maddie's eyes grow wide, like a deer in headlights. It begins to settle in what's going on. She snaps out of her trance and snatches the book out of Nick's hand, stuffing it into her bag.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick looks up at her, but is immediately grabbed by the wrist and pulled out of his seat. Maddie makes a beeline out of the café. With Nick in tow and bright red, Maddie keeps her head down whilst determined to get away. Heads turn in the cafe to see the commotion, but the door swings shut before most can realize what is going on.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Down the street, past a couple of storefronts, Maddie pulls into an alley and swings Nick into a wall. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ah,” Nick winces in pain. Sliding down the wall he looks up to Maddie towering over him, “What was that for?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Don’t you say anything about what you saw to anyone, alright?” Maddie is fired up.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“About what?” everything happened so fast that Nick never connected the dots, “Oh you mean that manga you dropped out of your ba- Ow!” he was cut off as Maddie’s foot makes contact with his shin.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“That’s what you get for saying that. Next time, I not holding back.” She walks away and leaves him in the alley.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Feeling the effects of getting roughed up, Nick gets up off the ground. Walking back home as he was, Nick’s pocket begins to vibrate. Pulling out his phone, he notices a new message request from someone. “Thanks for the help today,” the message read, “Just remember I’m watching you,” Nick could feel a chill run down his spine.</p>
