			<h3>Part 4</h3>
			<p>It had been three weeks since the beginning of the semester. Nick and Maddie still see each other every day in Ms. Blake's class, though little has been said between the two. While they haven’t spoken, they keep track of one another. Always on the mind, they want to make sure little attention is brought to them.</p>

			<br/>
			<p>Late in the school day, Nick is changing out of his P.E. uniform in the locker room. Everybody there anxious to leave for the day. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>On the bench, his phone starts to buzz. Nick slams his locker shut and picks up the phone. Two new messages appeared. “I need to talk to you. Meet me on the side of the gym.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Curious, he leaves, heading for the side of the building. Suddenly a hand reaches out and snatches him by the arm. Pulling him around the corner Nick is greeted by Maddie.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“I need your help.” </p>
			<br/>
			<p id="divider">---</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Wait a second. You want me to go out and buy you manga while you hang out with your friends? Can’t you just wait until after?” Nick is trying to make sense of the situation that Maddie has presented him with.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You don’t understand, Nick. I was in good standing with these people. I was close to the top of the food chain, but ever since I met you on the street…” Maddie voice trails off. “Listen, I need today to be with them so I can show them that everything is fine.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You know, I don’t think it’s healthy to be hanging out those people. Them forcing you to be a certain way and all,” Nick questions the way she operates her life.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Well what do you know, Nick. You’ve never been popular before,” Maddie snaps back.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oof, that hurts Maddie,” he replies, clearly wounded by her words, “Why do you need this book anyway? Couldn’t you just wait until your meetup is over with?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It’s not that simple. The first 500 copies sold will have a special promotional charm and a mini poster that comes with it.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>All Nick does is rolls his eyes and scoffs.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Come on, Nick. Please? Here, I’ll pay you back plus…” she digs around her bag, “five dollars.” Maddie smiles as she holds out the crumpled up bill.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick sighs, “Fine I’ll do it.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Okay what if I throw in- wait, really?” Maddie couldn’t believe it.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“If you’ll finally let me go home, sure,” Nick just knew that this was the only way out of this conversation. “Just what manga do you want me to buy exactly?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Maddie stares at him as a grin grows on her face.</p>
			<br/>
			<p id="divider">---</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The doors slide open and Nick is greeted to shelves of books. He walks in and starts turning his head, looking for the manga section. His pace is faster than normal, just slightly slower than a jog to avoid drawing attention to himself. Eventually he finds the correct section and is immediately presented with the new releases.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick checks his phone, as Maddie sent him a picture of what he was to look for. He thought that it was going to be a relatively normal manga like a shounen or a slice of life, but no. It turns out to be one that he wants to avoid holding at any cost, My Little Sister’s a Magical Girl?!?. Identifying the book, he takes one of the few remaining from the shelf. Wasting no time, Nick goes to the register.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>He pulls up to the counter and quickly puts the book face down on the counter. Thinking that he’s so smart so that the cover won’t show, he didn’t ever realize that the back wasn’t any much better than the front.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Did you find everything alright-” The clerk says as she scans the book.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Yes, yes I did.” Nick says trying to hurry up the transaction process.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh! Looks like you still qualify for the special promos. Let me go and get those for you,” she leaves to go and get the extra goodies. Nick begins to swivel his head whilst tapping his fingers on the counter.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The clerk comes back with a pink wand charm and a small rolled up poster. She rings up the book for Nick, “Ok, that will be $16.25-”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Here you go” Nick had already calculated the price with tax when she was gone and had the cash ready to go. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Would you like a bag with tha-”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Please” Nick cuts her off.</p>
			<br/>
			<p id="divider">---</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Thank you come again!” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick hurries out the door looking around if anyone saw him buy it. His pulls out his phone to text the one who wanted this stuff, “Hey, I got your dumb anime. Where do you want to pick it up at?” He slides his phone back into his pocket and starts walking off. However, his phone starts vibrating immediately. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Pulling his phone back out, he reads her text, “Idk somewhere with no one around.” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>He pauses for a second to think of places where people don’t go often, “What about the park? You know the one near our houses.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“That park?” Maddie seems a bit hesitant about his choice.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Well if you got any better ideas then shoot.” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick stares at his phone, waiting for a response. After a minute, he sees her typing, “Ok fine. Be there in 15 min.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>He slips his phone back into his pocket once more, but this time he was unaware of the girl passing by right in front of him. A solid thump could be heard as they hit one another. The bag that Nick was holding falls out of his hand and all of the contents spill out onto the sidewalk.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh I’m so sorry,” the girl drops to her knees as Nick does too. Both picking up the merchandise he had just bought. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It’s ok, I wasn’t looking where I was going,” Nick grabs the charm and the poster and stuffs it back into the bag. He couldn’t find the book however. Looking up, he could see the girl holding the book. Looking at the cover with a disgusted look, she turns her head to face him. “Listen, that book’s for a friend you see and-” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Get away from me you weirdo!” the girls shoves the book into Nick and runs away.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick puts the book back into the bag and walks away. He only notices a few faces looking towards him and the commotion. Taking out his phone, he notices the time and starts to hurry towards the park.</p>
			<br/>
			<p id="divider">---</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Slowly walking into the park, Nick checks his phone to see he still has two minutes to spare. He looks around and notices Maddie sitting alone on a bench. She’s busy on her phone and doesn’t notice him as he approaches. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“How’s it going?” he startles her just a bit. “Are you all good with your friends?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh, uh yeah,” she regains her composure and then asks in a hushed voice, “Do you have the stuff?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick sighs and presents her with the bag. Maddie immediately snatches it from his hand without hesitation. She looks into the bag and swiftly takes out the book to inspect it, front and back. As she gazes at her treasure, Nick takes a seat next to her, tired from running. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>He couldn’t help to notice how happy she was looking at the book. Even if it was questionable in topic, it looks like she’s having a great time. She really must’ve wanted it bad.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh, sorry if there’s any dirt on it. I bumped into some girl and it fell out of the bag onto the sidewalk.” Nick tries to explain the small of the damage, but it just seems like everything is going in one ear and out the other.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>After some time Nick gets up to leave. Before he can get too far, he hears a voice.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Hey, wait up, Nick!” Maddie calls out to him. He turns around and sees her waving money at him. “Don’t you want your money?” Completely forgetting that he’s supposed to be paid back, he walks back to take the money. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Walking away again, he hears her voice once more, “Oh and Nick,” he turns around, “thanks for getting me this.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>They both smile and wave goodbye to each other. Nick leaves the park while Maddie sits on the bench. With the sun going down, she opens her new book to start the first page.</p>
