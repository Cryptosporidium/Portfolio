			<h3>Part 3</h3>
			<p>Maddie stands at the front of the class, stunned to see Nick and vice versa.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Everyone this is Madeline O’Dwyer. She is the newest addition to our class.” Maddie puts on a smile for the class as she is introduced by Ms. Blake. “Ah it seems that there is an empty seat next to Nick. How about you make that your seat?” Maddie nods to the teacher and walks towards the back of the room to her new seat. As she walks down the aisle, she doesn’t take one look at Nick, intensely focused on her destination. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>She takes out her notes and pencil pouch with no recognition that Nick is even there. Meanwhile Nick is still in shock, watching her every move. Even when the lesson starts he is taking peeks to see what Maddie is doing. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“And with that table, you can easily find the sine of-“ Ms. Blake is cut off by the bell. “Ok that’s all for today, remember your homework is pages 92-93, number one through seven…” Everyone starts packing up, drowning out Ms. Blake’s voice. “If you need any help I’ll still be here for homeroom!” She shouts over class knowing that only maybe three kids heard her.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Are you looking for something?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“What?” Nick asks, surprised by Maddie’s voice.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You keep looking over here. Is there something you need?” Maddie asks with a bit of tension in her voice.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh no no no not at all” Nick stammers</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Good” Maddie smiles and gets up out of her seat</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Wait,” Nick stops her in her tracks, “Why are you in my class?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It wasn’t my choice. I had a scheduling conflict so I was switched in here. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to lunch.” Nick watches her leave out the classroom door. She never breaks stride or takes time to look back at him.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>As he is watching, Nick is approached by a couple of his classmates, “Hey, you know Madeline O’Dwyer?” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick hesitates just a little bit and thinking about what she would want him to say, “Um yeah. Just a tiny bit I guess…” His voice trails off.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Man that's awesome. I wish I was that close to her, she’s so cool…” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>They keep talking while Nick’s eyes drift to the space between the two, focused on the desk left empty behind them.</p>
			<br/>
			<p id="divider">---</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Focused on the desk, a boy pumps himself up. “Ok, it isn’t that hard it’s just a girl.” The nervous 8th grader walks over to sit down in an empty desk next to a moody girl who was focused on something in her notebook. “Um excuse me?” he taps the girl on the shoulder. He then is met with a glare. “Um, hi. Are you Madeline?” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Yeah. What’s it to you?” A small Madeline bites back at him.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh, um I’m Nick. It seems that Ms. Robinson has paired us together for the project.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>She looks around at the rest of the kids grouped up realizing she missed something. She lets out a big sigh, “Ok let’s get to work then”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick talks to her about the project but many of the responses were halfhearted and unenthusiastic noises. Sometimes she would be more attentive to her work in her notebook than with anything Nick had to say. The bell rings and Madeline packs up quickly, leaving without saying much of a goodbye. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Feeling only a little bit good about the encounter, Nick packs up his things too. On the desk he notices that she left behind a pen with a little charm on it. “Oh she must have left this,” he thinks to himself, “I’ll give it to her tomorrow.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick leaves school and heads home. On his way back, he passes a park and sees her. Madeline was sitting on a fence, looking out over the city, doing something in her notebook again. Nick walks over to her and startles her a little bit. He is met with another glare and a threatening, “What do you want?” Madeline says in an aggressive manner.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Um,” He reaches into his pocket to grab the pen. “You left this in class.” Slowly he reaches it out to her.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh, uh thanks…” she backs off a bit on her tone.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Nick goes back in his memory and thinks about it. Before and even when they were working together, she was doing a lot in her notebook. He looks down at the pad in her lap. “You like to draw?” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Yeah. It helps me block out things,” Madeline goes back to her work in her notebook.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It’s looks really nice.” He says sincerely</p>
			<br/>
			<p>After he said that, Madeline looks at him. You could see a little bit of a warm smile growing on her face. “Uh, thanks.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The two would stay in the park talking for another hour before parting ways. This would be the catalyst to the two’s friendship</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>“And after eighth grade, I haven’t seen her since until now,” Nick says over voice chat.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“That’s great Nick, but could you help the team and push the payload?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh sorry about that AJ.” Nick was back at home after a long day at school playing some games with AJ his longtime friend.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It’s cool dude, but remember, I still want to win this.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ya know, it’s really weird, I haven’t seen her in a couple of years, and then she just pops up out of nowhere? I mean what are the odds?” Nick goes back to the topic of Maddie.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“C’mon c’mon. Yeah!” AJ celebrates as the screen flashes the word ‘Victory’ on screen. “I don’t know man, but did you see that push at the end? That was all me.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Uh huh yeah…” Nick plays it off as AJ changes the subject. Nick looks at the time. The clock reading midnight. “Hey AJ I think I’m gonna get to bed. I got school tomorrow.” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ok man have a good night”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You too AJ”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Right as Nick was going to leave AJ pipes up one more time. “Hey man, if you want my advice, try talking to her. Message her or something.” AJ disconnects, leaving him alone for the night. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Taking off his headphones, Nick leans back into his chair, “Message her, huh?” He looks to the edge of the desk, where his phone rests. </p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>Maddie walks out of the bathroom ready for bed. She jumps in and flops over on her sheets, grabbing a manga from the bedside. All smiles, she starts to open her book when a light and rumble emits from her phone. She reaches over to look. After reading the text, she looks at her desk, takes a moment, and sighs. Maddie sets down her phone and goes back to her book. The screen reads, “Are you still drawing?”</p>
