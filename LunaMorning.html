			<h3>Luna's Morning</h3>
			<p> “-na. –una. Come on Luna, Mamá says that you have to get up or you’ll be late for school,” a small voice creeps into the world.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Luna slowly opens up her eyes and sees a small body shaking her arm at the foot of her bed.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Mamá says that you need to come down now,” the little body says.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ok Julio I’m up now,” she sits up in her bed and rubs her eyes. Luna ruffles her little brother’s hair, “Why don’t you go and tell Mamá that I’ll be down in a little bit alright?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Julio smiles and runs out her bedroom door. From the room you could hear the tiny voice, “Mamá, Luna’s coming down soon.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Getting out of bed, Luna looks out the window and stretches her arms. She opens up her closet and quickly gets dressed. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Luna hops down the stairs and heads to the kitchen. A delicious smell filled the Rodriguez household. When she turns into the kitchen she sees the source of the smell. Her Mamá and Papá were already working hard preparing food for the day ahead. Every day was an early day for Luna’s Mamá and Papá. Being the owners of a quite popular Mexican restaurant in town, they prepare some food in advance at home. Today’s the day they make fresh tamales. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Buenos días, Mamá. Buenos días, Papá,” Luna greets her parents with a hug.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Buenos días, Luna,” her Papá replies.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Staying up late again?” her Mamá inquires.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh don’t worry Mamá, I was only doing school work,” she tries to appease her mother.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Walking over to the table, Luna sees her younger sister, Isabelle, looking over notes before her day at school. “Hey kiddo, working hard even in the morning huh.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Isabelle looks up from her notes to see Luna. “Oh, hi sis. Ms. Cooper’s giving us a test today and I’m worried about how I’ll do.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“I’m sure you’ll do fine. Just stay calm do you best,” Luna reassures her little sister.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Okay…” Isabelle replies. Luna leans down and kisses her on the forehead as good luck. She checks the clock and notices that she needs to leave that moment. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Ah! I gotta go,” she exclaims and rushes over to put on her shoes. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>In her haste she hears her mom, “Luna, remember you said you would help out at the restaurant tonight?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“I know mamá. I’ll be back in time,” Luna grabs her skateboard and whisks out the door, “Adiós!”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Be careful out there,” Luna’s mom calls out as the door slams.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“You know you don’t have to worry about her. She’s old enough to take care of herself,” Luna’s papá reassures her.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“But I always worry about her. She goes off on that skateboard and…” Luna’s mamá sighs, “I just want her to be safe, Ricardo.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It’ll be fine, she’s young; she just has a lot of ambition in her. One day she’ll learn to settle down and take it easy just like you did.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>He gives her a kiss on the cheek. When he pulls back, she calls out to her husband, “Uh hon, the soup is boiling over.” </p>
			<br/>
			<p>"Ay, Dios mío," he runs over to the stove as the kids start to chuckle.</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>Rushing out the door, Luna puts on her music, throws down her board, and takes off full speed. On the way to school she waves hi to many of the people she passes. All of them she knows as friends of family or as regulars from the restaurant. She slides up to a traffic light and waits for it to turn green. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Hey Luna,” she turns to see someone yelling from their porch. “Is your mamá making green chile tamales today?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh! Hi Mr. Hernandez,” Luna perks up, “You know she always makes her green chile tamales.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“I know I know. I just like to make sure. Can you see if she can save me some?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The signal changes and Luna begins to skate off, “I’ll try to remember, but you should come around earlier anyway and get them fresh. See you around Mr. Hernandez!”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>A couple of minutes later Luna rolls up to school. With a few minutes to spare, she jogs into her first period. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Luna walks over to her desk neighbor and slips their headphones off, “Guess whooooo.” Luna says toying with them.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“Oh no a thief, alert the police,” the girl says dryly as she snatches her headphones back, barely turning her head. </p>
			<br/>
			<p>Luna chuckles and sits down at her desk. “How has your morning gone, Ash?”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“It was going fine until you took my music from me,” she says unamused. “You know, you shouldn’t bother blind people like that. You might just get some bad karma for that,” Ash shoots back.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>“But you’ve been my friend for years, so it’s okay.”</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Ash sighs, still not amused</p>
			<br/>
			<p>BRRRRRING, the school bell rings and so does the day begin</p>
			<br/>

			<p>A/N: This is supposed to be a bit of a character introduction for a planned series. It involves a group of high schoolers who can do extraordinary things with powers or items they have. Ash is a character that I wrote a morning for, but have since scrapped it and plan on re-writing it in my new style. Ash is blind and cannot see, but because of technology her mother put into her, she can "see" through ecolocation. Luna here doesn't have any powers, but will gain something later that will make her more special. My hope is that I can create such a massive project, though it'll take time.</p>
