				<h3>Pep Band Shirt Design</h3>
				<p>Each and every year in high school, I would take time to create a shirt design for the school's pep band I was apart of. This was the design I created for my Senior year</p>

				<h3>Not Smash x Ganon Bracket</h3>

				<h3>Joyful Monster Alt Album Art</h3>
				<p>Inspired by the Persona 5 logo, I decided to create new album art for the J-Pop band Little Glee Monster's Joyful Monster. The album included a song "Catch Me If You Can" which ties in nice with the Phantom Thieves, the protagonists from Persona 5.</p>

				<h3>Snow Day</h3>
				<p>Using charcoal and pencil has been one of my favorite ways to draw. Always drawing things around daylight, I thought it would be more interesting to draw a snowy night.</p>

				<h3>A Hard Day's Work</h3>
				<p>This drawing was inspired by a story that I read long ago, where someone helping out on the farm would always spend time looking at the sunset. Sunsets create interesting shadows and lighting, so using charcoal to push and move the shadows in directions and make them harsher was a big challenge to get that full effect.</p>
